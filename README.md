<p align="center"> The Notes App is a modern-designed application that provides a comprehensive and secure way for users to manage their notes. It features user authentication with secure login and registration, ensuring that each user's notes are kept private. </p>

The app also includes URL protection to restrict access to authenticated users only and allows users to archive notes for future reference. This combination of features makes the Notes App an efficient and reliable tool for managing personal notes.
